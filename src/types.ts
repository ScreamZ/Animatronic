/**
 * Each function accepts arguments for the parameters t, b, c and d.
 *
 * @param timePassed Time - Amount of time that has passed since the beginning of the animation. Usually starts at 0 and is slowly increased using a game loop or other update function.
 * @param startValue Beginning value - The starting point of the animation. Usually it's a static value, you can start at 0 for example.
 * @param deltaValue Change in value - The amount of change needed to go from starting point to end point. It's also usually a static value.
 * @param duration Duration - Amount of time the animation will take. Usually a static value as well.
 *
 * So in short b, c and d are mostly used as static settings for the easing and t needs to get updated frequently to make the animation progress.
 *
 * The value for t and d can be given in time (e.g. seconds or milliseconds) but you could also use frames or percentage of completion. As long as they both use the same unit. Take a look at the equation for linear motion for example (it's the most simple one and not so much a real ease, but a good example):
